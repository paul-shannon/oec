The oxygen-evolving complex is the nutcracker that pinions water ‘just
so’ to have its electrons cracked out one by one. When all the
electrons are removed, the invaluable waste, oxygen, is flushed out
into the world. The oxygen-evolving complex is really a component of
Photosystem II, but sits at the very edge, facing the outside world,
and gives a sense of being ‘tacked on’. It’s shockingly small. The
complex is a cluster of four manganese atoms and a single calcium
atom, all held together by a lattice of oxygen atoms. And that’s
that. For some years, the irrepressible Mike Russell, whom we already
met in Chapters 1 and 2, has argued that the structure of this complex
is remarkably similar to some minerals cooked up in hydrothermal
vents, such as hollandite or tunnel calcium manganite. But until 2006,
we didn’t know the structure of the manganese cluster in atomic
resolution, and Russell’s was a voice in the wilderness. But now we
know. And although Russell was not quite right, his broad conception
was absolutely correct. The structure, as revealed by a team headed by
Vittal Yachandra at Berkeley, bears a striking resemblance to what he
proposed: 

  <blockquote><i>
      "ancient mineral structure ... four manganese atoms
       linked by oxygen in a lattice, with a calcium atom nearby"

</i></blockquote>

Whether the original oxygen-evolving complex was simply a bit of
mineral that got wedged in Photosystem II, we don’t know. Perhaps
manganese atoms became bound to oxygen in a lattice as they were
oxidised by ultraviolet radiation, seeding the growth of a tiny
crystal on site.  Perhaps the proximity of this cluster to
chlorophyll, or to adjacent bits of protein, distorted it a little in
some way, optimising its function. But whatever the origin of the
cluster, there is a huge sense of the accidental about it. It is far
too close to a mineral structure to be the product of biology. Like a
few other metal clusters found at the heart of enzymes, it is almost
certainly a throwback to the conditions found billions of years ago in
a hydrothermal vent.
<p>

Most precious of all jewels, the metal cluster was wrapped in a
protein and held in trust for all eternity by the
cyanobacteria. However it formed, this little cluster of manganese
atoms opened up a new world, not only for the bacteria that first
trapped it, but for all life on our planet. Once it formed, this
little cluster of atoms started to split water, the four oxidised
manganese atoms combining their natural avidity to yank electrons from
water, thereby releasing oxygen as waste. Stimulated by the steady
oxidation of manganese by ultraviolet radiation, the splitting of
water would have been slow at first. But as soon as the cluster became
coupled to chlorophyll, electrons would have started to flow. Getting
faster as chlorophyll became adapted to its task, water was sucked in,
split open, its electrons drawn out, oxygen discarded. Once a trickle,
ultimately a flood, this life-giving flow of electrons from water is
behind all the exuberance of life on earth. We must thank it
twice–once for being the ultimate source of all our food, and then
again for all the oxygen we need to burn up that food to stay alive.

<p>

It’s also the key to the world’s energy crisis. We have no need for
two photosystems, for we’re not interested in making organic
matter. We only need the two products released from water: oxygen and
hydrogen. Reacting them together again generates all the energy we’ll
ever need, and the only waste is water. In other words, with this
little manganese cluster, we can use the sun’s energy to split water,
and then react the products back together again to regenerate
water–the hydrogen economy. No more pollution, no more fossil fuels,
no more carbon footprints, no more anthropogenic global warming,
albeit still some danger of explosions. If this little cluster of
atoms changed the makeup of the world long ago, knowing its structure
should be the first step to changing our own world today. As I write,
chemists around the world are racing to synthesise this tiny manganese
cluster in the lab, or something similar that works as well. Soon,
surely, they will succeed. And then it can’t be long before we learn
to live on water and a splash of sunshine.
